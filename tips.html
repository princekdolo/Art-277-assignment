        As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully
vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still

        “‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 <br>
vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against <br>
severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No <br>
vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give <br>
you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of <br>

being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.” <br>

        While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower
rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune
response to vaccines.

    <p>
        “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health
disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines.
We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these
vulnerable populations.”
